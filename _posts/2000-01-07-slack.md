####Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called “channels”, and we have several set up. There are two you’ll be in by default:

- **#introductions** is the first place for newcomers to start, a place to meet core community members and other newcomers before diving into general discussions elsewhere.
- **#general** is for mostly DevOps practitioner day-to-day discussion, and specifically NOT for posts on hiring, tech events, or other marketing content. Read the posts a few weeks before today to get a sense for what our community expects in the general channel.

####Opt-in Channels 
- **#jobs** is it’s own channel, if you have a job to post PLEASE read that channel’s description for required details that should be in your post, specifically that salary range is required -- otherwise if not provided it will get deleted quickly.
- **#content-share** if you have something useful for DevOps folks, like an article, white paper, tutorial, etc. link, please use that channel instead of general
- **#events** is for upcoming tech events, virtual or otherwise
- **#bookclub** meets every Tuesday at 6pm, check that channel for schedule and which book(s) are currently being worked through
- **#random** is for banter and discussions that you don’t feel fits any of these other categories

...and many more!
